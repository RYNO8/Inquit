The .app file is coming soon (hopefully...)

For those not going to `Sydney Boys`, get me the name of your school wifi, and I can make a version of this for you.

# Version 1.1 is out!

yay! v2 should come out soon (that is, before half-life 3). Have fun waiting!

- Fixed bugs with keypress (e.g. ctrl-left, f1, greek characters)

- Fixed copy and paste bug

- I've disabled non ascii keys. hehe!

- Do you like the new icon?

# Note that:

- I can't fix a bad gateway error (502 or 504). To simplify, its a problem with the wifi.

- When entering a room, you can only view the last 5 messages.

- Rooms last for 24 hours after the last message. It would cost around $2 if you want it to last for 30 days. 

- **Don't** spam enter. It will lag (it takes longer to send than it does to press enter)

- It is possible to fake your username, so someone may not necessarily be who they say they are...

- Try not to use a common room name, since people could guess it.

- Pls post bugs in issues. I will hopefully fix it soon.

- Sorry for the epilepsy in advance. Hehe
