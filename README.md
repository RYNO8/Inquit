# Inquit - Ryan Ong and Nathan Jones


Current version: 1.1

The .app file is coming soon (hopefully)

.

----------PATCH v1.1----------

yay! v2 should come out within the next month. Have fun waiting!

- fixed bugs with keypress (e.g. ctrl-left, f1, greek characters)

- fixed copy and paste bug

- I've disabled non ascii keys. hehe!

.

Note:

I can't fix a bad gateway error (502 or 504). To simplify, its a problem with the wifi.

Don't spam enter. It will lag (it takes longer to send than it does to press enter)

It is possible to fake your username, so someone may not necessarily be who they say they are...

Try not to use a common room name, since people could guess it.

Pls post bugs in issues. I will hopefully fix it soon.

Sorry for the epilepsy in advance. Hehe

.

----------HELP----------

I felt that it should be quite self-explanatory


To start a new room, enter a unique name or type new to get a generated name

To join a room, enter the code given to you.

When entering a room, you can only view the last 5 messages.

Rooms last for 24 hours after the last message. It would cost around $2 if you want it to last for 30 days. 

Fn-11 / Alt-Enter toggles between fullscreen and not fullscreen?

.

Left/right - move cursor

Backspace, del - delete character

Esc - exit program politely

Enter - send message
