# ----------PATCH v1.1----------

yay! v2 should come out within the next month. Have fun waiting!

- Fixed bugs with keypress (e.g. ctrl-left, f1, greek characters)

- Fixed copy and paste bug

- I've disabled non ascii keys. hehe!

- Do you like the new icon?

# Note:

I can't fix a bad gateway error (502 or 504). To simplify, its a problem with the wifi.

When entering a room, you can only view the last 5 messages.

Rooms last for 24 hours after the last message. It would cost around $2 if you want it to last for 30 days. 

Don't spam enter. It will lag (it takes longer to send than it does to press enter)

It is possible to fake your username, so someone may not necessarily be who they say they are...

Try not to use a common room name, since people could guess it.

Pls post bugs in issues. I will hopefully fix it soon.

Sorry for the epilepsy in advance. Hehe
