Note:

I can't fix a bad gateway error (502 or 504). To simplify, its a problem with the wifi.

Don't spam enter. It will lag (it takes longer to send than it does to press enter)

Don't spam through copying chunks of text in. People will make a new room without you!

It is possible to fake your username, so someone may not necessarily be who they say they are...

Try to use a common room name, since people could guess it.

Pls post bugs in issues. I will hopefully fix it soon.

Sorry for the epilepsy in advance. Hehe

----------HELP----------

I felt that it should be quite self-explanatory


To start a new room, enter a unique name or type new to get a generated name

To join a room, enter the code given to you.

When entering a room, you can only view the last 5 messages.

Rooms last for 24 hours after the last message. It would cost around $2 if you want it to last for 30 days. 

Fn-11 toggles between fullscreen and not fullscreen?

Cool function (this wasn't intentional): drag a file or folder from file explorer to Inquit. It will copy the link.

Left/right - move cursor

Backspace, del - delete character
